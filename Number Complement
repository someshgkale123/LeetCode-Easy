Problem Statement:

Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Example 1:
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
 
Example 2:
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
 

Solution:
class Solution:
    def findComplement(self, num: int) -> int:
        '''
        b=bin(num)[2:]
        n="1"*len(b)
        return(int(n,2)-num)
        '''
        b=bin(num)[2:]
        res=""
        for i in b:
            if i=="0":
                res+="1"
            else:
                res+="0"
        return int(res,2)
