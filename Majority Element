Problem Statement:

Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.
You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

Example 1:
Input: [3,2,3]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2




Solution:

class Solution(object):
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        for i in set(nums):
            if nums.count(i) > int(len(nums)/2):
                return i
