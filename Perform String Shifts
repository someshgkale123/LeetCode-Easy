Problem Statement:

You are given a string s containing lowercase English letters, and a matrix shift, where shift[i] = [direction, amount]:
direction can be 0 (for left shift) or 1 (for right shift). 
amount is the amount by which string s is to be shifted.
A left shift by 1 means remove the first character of s and append it to the end.
Similarly, a right shift by 1 means remove the last character of s and add it to the beginning.
Return the final string after all operations.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", shift = [[0,1],[1,2]]
Output: "cab"
Explanation: 
[0,1] means shift to left by 1. "abc" -> "bca"
[1,2] means shift to right by 2. "bca" -> "cab"

Example 2:
Input: s = "abcdefg", shift = [[1,1],[1,1],[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: "efgabcd"
Explanation:  
[1,1] means shift to right by 1. "abcdefg" -> "gabcdef"
[1,1] means shift to right by 1. "gabcdef" -> "fgabcde"
[0,2] means shift to left by 2. "fgabcde" -> "abcdefg"
[1,3] means shift to right by 3. "abcdefg" -> "efgabcd"

Solution:
class Solution:
    def stringShift(self, s: str, shift: List[List[int]]) -> str:
        li=list(s)
        for i,j in shift:
            if i==0:
                for each in range(j):
                    temp=li.pop(0)
                    li.append(temp)
            if i==1:
                for each in range(j):
                    temp=li.pop(-1)
                    li.insert(0,temp)
        return("".join(li))
