Problem Statement:

Suppose we have a class:

public class Foo {
  public void first() { print("first"); }
  public void second() { print("second"); }
  public void third() { print("third"); }
}
The same instance of Foo will be passed to three different threads. Thread A will call first(), thread B will call second(), and thread C will call third(). Design a mechanism and modify the program to ensure that second() is executed after first(), and third() is executed after second().

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: "firstsecondthird"
Explanation: There are three threads being fired asynchronously. The input [1,2,3] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls second(), and thread C calls third(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.

Example 2:
Input: [1,3,2]
Output: "firstsecondthird"
Explanation: The input [1,3,2] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls third(), and thread C calls second(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.



Solution:
from threading import Lock
class Foo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.f=Lock()
        self.s=Lock()
        self.f.acquire()
        self.s.acquire()

    def first(self, printFirst: 'Callable[[], None]') -> None:
        
        # printFirst() outputs "first". Do not change or remove this line.
        printFirst()
        self.f.release()

    def second(self, printSecond: 'Callable[[], None]') -> None:
        with self.f:
        # printSecond() outputs "second". Do not change or remove this line.
            printSecond()
            self.s.release()
    
    def third(self, printThird: 'Callable[[], None]') -> None:
        
        with self.s:
        # printThird() outputs "third". Do not change or remove this line.
            printThird()
